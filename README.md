# Shoprite 
Made some changes to mortonfox's extension to work as userscript.

[Shoprite Coupon Page
](https://www.shoprite.com/sm/planning/rsid/538/digital-coupon)

'Load All to Card' button will add all coupons
# Target
Userscript to clip "all" the deals on  https://www.target.com/circle/deals

There is a limit to the number of coupons you can clip :sob:  
You will just get a prompt from target to replace clipped coupons

'Load All' to load all the coupons on page

'Load All to Card' will clip all the coupons on the page
