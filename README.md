I just took that and change it a little to work as a userscript.
Also used as a starting point for the target clipper

# Target
Userscript to clip "all" the deals on  https://www.target.com/circle/deals

There is a limit to the number of coupons you can clip :sob:  
You will just get a prompt from target to replace clipped coupons

## Usage: 
1. The page has a load more button, to get around this use the Load All button on.
2. An alert will show when the page is loaded, and will attempt to scroll you close to the load all to card button.
3. Press Load all to Card.
